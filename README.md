## Installation

To set up the codebase you can follow these general steps:

   `NPM`: < v8.1.2 </br>
   `Visual Studio`: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

2. Clone the codebase from [Github](https://github.com/LAHI-Lighthoue/lighthouse-base-web.git)  to your local machine.

3. Now we need to download angular Cli by running this command-
   `npm install -g @angular/cli`

4. Open a terminal in the project's root directory and run
   `npm install` to install the project's dependencies.

5. Now to start frontend server we just need to run `ng serve` command.
